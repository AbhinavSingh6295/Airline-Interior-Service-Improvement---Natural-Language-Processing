Sure, there's no pillow or bar service- they've warned about this on their website, but as it turned out, when they said they would be serving pre-packaged meals, all they meant was that they weren't going to plate your meal for you.

14,air-canada,"""seats are very narrow""",27th October 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  The most uncomfortable long haul flight I have been on. I was seated in row 38, an aisle seat on the Boeing 787-9. I am fairly close to average size (barely 6 feet tall and 185 pounds), so not tiny but neither am I a giant by any means. My knees were just about touching the seat in front of me, the seats are very narrow, and thankfully the passenger seated in the middle seat was not large but he did fill the seat and needed all his elbow room. The seats are very short, offering little or no support to the thighs. This adds to the discomfort, particularly on a long flight. I could not stretch both my legs out fully at all while seated. Trying to use some of the aisle is next to impossible due to the extremely narrow aisles. There is barely room for the refreshment carts to pass. I spent a great deal of time on the flight moving my arm and shoulder inwards as the carts and other passengers were passing and bumping into me and there was no space. Seat backs are very thin and offer no support either. Due to all the factors mentioned, I found sleep to be impossible. The passenger at the window seat managed about an hour's sleep but basically had the same complaint, and needed muscle relaxers for her back towards the end of the flight. Anyone getting out of their seats found it necessary to pull on the seat in front of them for balance and leverage. For relief, I got up to stand and stretch at the rear of the plane 3 times on the eastbound flight and 4 times on the westbound leg. Also, on the outbound flight, our connection was a little late so we went straight to board our London flight without buying snacks, etc. Be warned, we found out on board that in economy you cannot buy snacks. You have to content yourself with the dinner and continental breakfast and I think you get a very small bag of pretzels with a drink. Cabin is beautiful. The in-flight entertainment system was excellent, although some people were asking why wi-fi was not available. The selection of movies, TV programs, and interactive games was OK for me. In summary, I will do everything I possibly can to avoid using this aircraft again. If it even means connecting through another city, I will do it.

16,air-canada,"""choose seat due to extra legroom""",10th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified |  This review is based on exit row 31 on the Boeing 787-8. I was in seat 31J from Vancouver to Brisbane, a nearly 15 hour flight. I specifically chose this seat due to the extra legroom it provided. On this particular flight it was $150 extra to select the seat as it is classified as preferred (not to be confused with premium economy). When we boarded the plane there was a small overhead bin above our row that was able to fit all of my and my partners bags (2 backpacks, a suit bag and a shopping bag of snacks) as we were unable to store anything for takeoff. I was expecting brief instructions from one of the flight attendants on how the emergency door worked as we were right beside it however this never happened, I assume because there was a flight attendant jump seat facing us on the other side of the exit. Once the flight took off and the seatbelt sign was off we were able to get a few things from the overhead bin above and had no issues from the flight attendants storing the on the floor, we just made sure there were right against our seat so as to not block the emergency exit. The tray tables were in the armrests which made it difficult to get too if the person beside you was asleep with their arm on the opening. The entertainment screen was a folding arm below the armrest that swung up in front of you. For me it was not high enough and it did not quite sit centred in front of you which was slightly annoying.There were also 2 power supply outlets located on either side of the middle seat, nearly at the ground. I consider myself a tall with an average build (190cm 90kg, 6' 2"" 200lb) but the seats were exceptionally comfortable compared to other economy seats. The recline was average and the moveable headrest was ideal for someone as tall as I am. With the new 787s the seats recline in a way where your seat moves forward slightly when you recline the back. I can see this being an issue when you already have limited legroom, but for this seat it was a nice touch as it seemed to be more comfortable than just the back reclining. The extra legroom was the true winner though. You basically had unlimited legroom as the next row of seats was about 1.5 to 2 meters away. I could stretch my legs out as much as I want and with the unique way the seats recline I believe it was the most comfortable you could be trying to sleep in a seated position. The biggest downside was that in the centre was the washrooms, one on each aisle. Although you could not smell anything for the duration of the flight, the door was quite loud when people let is slam. Also people would line up for the washroom in the area directly in front of you. At one point in the middle of a deep sleep a gentleman tripped over my legs as he was waiting in line and fell right on top of me! Other than that the flight went smoothly, I just put some earplugs in and that drowned out most of the people, children and washroom door slamming.

17,air-canada,"""seats do offer good recline""",6th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flight attendants aren't overly friendly, but they are helpful and attentive, walking up and down the aisles quite often. Aside from the in-flight meal, the cabin crew does come around with drinks and more complimentary snacks quite often. Because Air Canada use a 3x4x3 layout for their 777, seats may feel a bit cramped. This is particularly noticeable when you're trying to have your in-flight meals and you're bumping elbows with your neighbour (the food is good though, even for economy class standards). I consider myself to be average build for someone who is 5'8, and those seats were still reasonably comfortable. I would say however that for the seats on the middle-column, under-seat stowage is odd, since you only get 3 holes for 4 people to put their bags under, which means your neighbour's carry-on may encroach on your legroom. These seats do offer good recline, as the back reclines as the seat cushion slides forward. With the amount of leg room you get, this typically doesn't reduce your legroom dramatically enough to be uncomfortable. Seats are also quite plushy yet offer adequate back support, and the they offer an adjustable leather headrest. You will also find that throughout the flight, the new 777-300ERs feature the Boeing 787 mood-lighting which gradually changes colour throughout the flight. It looks cool and I did rest well on the flight, but there is a relationship between mood lighting and the quality of my rest has yet to be determined.",9.0,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300ER,3x4x3,light attendants overly friendly helpful attentive walking aisles quite often aside flight meal cabin crew come drinks complimentary snacks quite often seats may feel bit cramped particularly noticeable trying flight meals bumping elbows neighbour food good though even economy class standards consider average build seats still reasonably comfortable would say however seats middle column seat stowage odd get holes people put bags means neighbour carry may encroach legroom seats offer good recline back reclines seat cushion slides forward amount leg room get typically reduce legroom dramatically enough uncomfortable seats also quite plushy yet offer adequate support offer adjustable leather headrest also find flight new ers feature mood lighting gradually changes colour flight looks cool rest well flight relationship mood lighting quality rest determined
18,air-canada,"""Seats extremely uncomfortable""",23rd October 2017,✅ Verified Review |  A330 seats are extremely uncomfortable. Airlines need to have a 'use-by' date on seat bottoms as older aircraft have seat bottoms which show a high degree of wear.

19,air-canada,"""seats extraordinarily uncomfortable""",14th October 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I am 5'4"" and normal weight. We were in row 30. We found the seats to be extraordinarily uncomfortable; little in the way of cushioning and no lumbar support. The seat pitch was terrible, they are too close together. I was unable to see or reach my belongings with my tray table down. This is particularly bad in the window seat. If you are on the aisle you can pull your belongings out to the side to reach them. If the seat in front of you is reclined it is in your face unless you recline yours too--creating a domino effect behind the first reclinee. We do not like the nickel and dime attitude of charging for seat selection ahead of time. On this flight from Portland OR to Toronto the charge is $45-46 for 'premium economy' (it did not look like seat pitch was noticeably better in these seats in front of the wing), and $21 for regular economy behind the wing. If you don't pay to choose a seat ahead of time, AC assigns you seats 24-hours ahead of flight time. Our seats were assigned by AC. We did get to sit together, but in row 30 out of 33. There is one toilet in economy class on this plane. The inside of the plane looked old and in need of minor repairs to seats and surrounds. Food and drink service was provided once at the beginning of the flight and once toward the end of the flight. Flight attendants were no-where to be seen between those times. (Probably serving in first class). USB ports at each seat, no AC outlet. Small screen on the back of the seat in front of you. A little high for me to comfortably view. But good movie selection.

The headrest has no wings like in economy class, so your head can flop from side to side when you sleep unless you remembered to bring a neck cushion.

36,air-canada,"""the worst seats ever""",12th May 2016,"We paid for extra legroom seats on two other long haul flights (Vancouver to Sydney and Barcelona to Montreal) and it was money well spent. Cannot say the say for the recent flight AC 08 Hong Kong to Vancouver. The bulkhead seats 31J and 31H were the worst seats ever. Yes, there was lots of legroom but the flight attendants use the space for parking their service carts and the bathroom is to the immdiate left and in constant use. People using the bathroom naturally congregated in the extra bulkhead space which meant stretching your legs into the extra space was impossible. Lots of loud chatter, doors opening, lights, people bumping into your feet and entertainment system and I felt Air Canada should be paying us to seat there.

The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I'm not particularly large so I don't know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table.

65,air-france,"""hardly any recline""",11th March 2014,"Adequate width. Hardly any recline. Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were ""dangling"". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passenger´ seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the ""upright"" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard. The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned. However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified.

They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height.

Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet.

However, due to my wife's back issues, she needs to lay flat or on her side for any extended periods. That left us with either business or trying out the sky couch. So we risked it and flew RT SFO to Auckland and found that this worked very well for us. She was able to curl up on the two seats with footrests up while I sat in the aisle seat. We didn't attempt to both lie down. It seemed pretty tight for that. But it was good for her and a much more economical alternative to business.

9,air-new-zealand,"""discomfort and frustration""",4th September 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Been wanting to try the economy sky couch on Air New Zealand for a while now, and on this trip from San Francisco to Auckland we chose to pay an extra $600 to reserve one. Sky Couch sounds great in theory - you get special seats in a row of 3 that have fold up footrests that fill the space between your seat and the next row up. And maybe if you an an adult traveling with a child it would be a really good system. However, for two adults it is an exercise in discomfort and frustration. My partner and I are both 5' 7"" and average weight, but we really struggled to find a position that was comfortable for more than a few minutes. I gave up after an hour and just sat up for the rest of the flight--between the seat belts digging into my back and the lack of leg space I was not going to get any sleep anyway. I was not happy.

13,air-new-zealand,"""worst airline we have travelled""",31st January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Family recently travelled to LAX and back from Melbourne via Auckland. In short this was the worst airline we have ever travelled on. Trip started well with a one up upgrade to premium economy and you can see why ANZ has done well in this category. However as we opted for the sky couch for the main leg you cannot bid for an upgrade and this is where ANZ really lets itself down. Pictures of the sky couch look very impressive however the truth is different. Dont know if they use tiny people but there is no way a small adult and 2 kids (of any age) can fit unto this space. Having 4 people in our family there was a need for another seat on the other side of the aisle. Economy seats for a so called international airline are the worst Ive ever seen. No width breadth or recline - simply terrible. Having to endure this on the return leg we decided to opt to bid for premium economy, however we had to give up a sky couch so that wasnt a tough decision. Saying that and having to endure the waiting timed via the customer service team who had on average a waiting time of 1 hour+ on 4 separate occassions, to place a bid because apparently no one ever had done this. Anyway our bid went through and the email confirmation stated that we'd hear 3 to 7 days prior if we'd be successful or not. When we heard nothing with 3 days to fo we called and were informed that we would now not hear anything till between 9 and 7 hours prior to the flight. With 7 hours to go we received an email stating we'd been unsuccessful and we'd lost the opportunity to rebook 2 sky couches (plan b) because we'd left it too late. Also due to protestors at LAX we were asked to arrive early because of potential disruptions. So resigned to the fact that we'd be flying back economy we were buoyed by the fact that our Auckland to Melbourne flight had been upgraded. However after arriving 4 hours early and dropping off the car we needed to walk 30 mins to the international airport. ANZ arent to blame for this of course, however the cabin crew were 3 hours late which is interesting considering they told us about the issue and all the passengers were on time. As a result connecting flights were missed, with no recompense in Auckland for those delayed. Our next flight was 8 hours later (currently writing this fron Auckland airport) and no airport lounge access was provided or upgrades given. To add in sult to injury we lost our premium economy upgrade, will need taxi fare to get home and have wasted a day of our lives.

The seat back though was like something out of a Beechcraft 1900 regional plane. There was maybe 5mm (1.4-1/3 of an inch) of padding over cross bars in the seat frame. I think Air NZ's domestic flights have more padding on 40 minute flights. So when you recline the seat your weight shifts to your back and the ache started or me about an hour into the flight. What a pitiful seat for such a long haul flight.  Worst I can recall on such a longhaul flight on any carrier ever. I had a ""premium"" seat booking of 57k where it loses 1 seat in a row to two.

26,air-new-zealand,"""not sure it's worth the extra cash""",21st November 2015,"Booked the Air New Zealand sky couch as an experiment on an overnight flight to try for some sleep due to a planned long-drive after landing. While the leg room on the Air New Zealand Boeing 777-300 seemed reasonable, the 3x4x3 layout means the seats are very narrow and the aisles even narrower. The sky couch option is offered in one section of the three seat layout and really, you should think of it as buying the third seat for extra room. The couch works by a section of each of the three seats hinging upwards to fill in the gap between your seat and the back of those in front. Note that this feature means that when you’re not using the sky couch set-up, the seat design means the seat has no gap behind your calves so you can’t tuck your legs in. Also when you hinge the seats back down, then anything on the floor (like your shoes) is pushed below your seat and you can’t get to them! Going back to the use of the couch there are two main problems. The first we expected, in that if you’re over about 5 feet tall, you need to bend your legs to fit into the space you’re got. However the second was not really advertised, in that there’s simply not enough space for two people to lie down side by side. The problem is at your hips – we’re in our early fifties and I’d say normal sized adults by modern standards. However the very limited space means you really are crammed together – there’s no chance at all of moving around if one of you gets uncomfortable and there’s a real scramble to get up for a toilet visit – and it’s nearly impossible to get your temperature right. Add to that you’re lying across three seats (even with the thin mattress they give you) then there are bits sticking in you meaning two people have almost no chance of getting a long period of sleep. We actually had a little more success with one of us sitting up and the other using the two seat space. A previous reviewer commented that if the seat in front reclines then it really affects the space you have – we found this wasn’t really an issue if you also reclined your seats – effectively everything cancelled out. So at an extra cost of £299 to buy the spare seat to convert to a sky couch (on this flight – I assume it varies) then I’m not sure that it’s worth the extra cash, but it does buy you a spare seat for extra room.",8.0,Economy Class,Boeing 777-300,3x4x3,booked overnight flight try sleep due planned long drive landing leg room seemed reasonable layout means seats narrow aisles even narrower sky couch option offered section seat layout really think buying third seat extra room couch works section seats hinging upwards fill gap seat back front note feature means using sky couch set seat design means seat gap calves legs also hinge seats back floor shoes pushed seat get going back use couch main problems first expected feet tall need bend legs got however second really advertised simply enough space people lie side side problem hips early fifties say normal sized adults modern standards however limited space means really crammed together chance moving around one gets uncomfortable real scramble get toilet visit nearly impossible get temperature right add lying seats even thin mattress give bits sticking meaning people almost chance getting long period sleep actually little success sitting using seat space previous reviewer commented seat front reclines really affects space found really issue also reclined seats effectively cancelled extra cost buy spare seat sky couch flight assume varies sure worth extra cash buy spare seat extra room

40,air-new-zealand,"""cramped for premium economy patrons""",1st March 2015,"My wife and I have flown with Air New Zealand from Canada to Queenstown using premium economy since 2006. While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul. Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the ""moon seats"" which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777-200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience. The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower. We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats. Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy. Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat. There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping. To use the phrase ""disappointing"" with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement. The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to $10000 for two adults. When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of $2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little. The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class.

The purple beanbag/footrest is very welcome. Flip your shoes off and settle in. The only thing that could be improved is the recline seating should be electronic buttons rather than manual.

While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey. On the return trip we tried the skycouch (2 adults travelling) and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for. We reclined the seats back and put it into 'bed' mode. For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats. The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey (even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also. The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person.

There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined.

And the isle seats have an especially small underseat area that can be difficult to get even a small backpack into.

Could barely get my water bottle to fit, not to mention my Nook, snack and eyemask. Seat is short, like a jump seat, not supporting thighs. While taxiing, after safety stuff, the entertainment center plays commercials with whole-plane audio. Even if you've turned off the screen, it sometimes pops on by itself, usually for announcements.

25,american-airlines,"""impossible to stretch my legs """,8th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  It had been awhile since I had flown American and first on a A321 and whoa! Both flight into and out of HNL from LAX were at max capacity - people had to check carry on's at the gate. Leg room was very nonexistent in regular economy.  I don't see how anyone with anything but an 'average' human body could possibly fit into the seats. It was impossible to stretch my legs out under the seat in front due to my carry on bag being stored there. I am a 5'10"", 160lbs man. I was lucky enough to score window seats on both flights and propped my feet up on the back of the arm rest and cabin wall for the duration of the flight. I was careful not to annoy the person in front of me, I know this is considered highly rude. Sleep was impossible. The tray tables are the new style - they are folded in half for storage, so they're kind of flimsy. I could not fully extend my laptop screen to use it during the flight. The seat in front of me was simply too close! I had to work up the courage to recline my seat. I was afraid of discomforting the passenger behind me. Recline makes the tray table inch awfully close to the person behind you if they are using their seat tray as well. The cushion of the seat was adequate for me. The seat pocket is useless for storing anything other than magazines, a bottle of water and/or book will not fit. Flight attendants were very warm and nice so that made up for the physical discomfort. Took some time to get beverage service initially distributed to all passengers. The flight in only offered water after the 1st service. The flight out offered full beverage service multiple times during flight. Seat entertainment was pretty good. And the screens do have privacy filters in case there are children seating next to you. Seat-to-seat messaging was cool. But the actual software was a bit laggy for 2017 but functional. Also, in flight wifi is useless. Don't waste your money unless you have hours of emails to respond to. Bathrooms were very clean. Also, on the flight in the pilot flew over all the islands and identified them by name - it was an amazing descent into Honolulu that I will always remember. The flight out from Honolulu offered stunning views of Diamond Head and Oahu but did not fly over the other islands. Flew the same aircraft from LAX-DFW in the middle seat - horrible. No place for my arms. Constantly fidgeting. It was miserable. I could not wait to get off that aircraft. Do not store your carry on under the seat in front of you if you can.

1,avianca,"""legroom was pretty large""",2nd April 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  For my flights with Avianca, I had the front row seat in economy on the A330. Row 7 has a missing window, but this isn’t too bad as you have one window for view, not a blank wall. The seat is quite old, but seems to be in good condition. To truly prove that an economy class seat is good, you need to fly it on an overnight flight. That is when you can truly say if it’s good or not. Unfortunately all my flights were day flights. The headrest was a first for me, never had a side ballast that folded down, rather than folded in! I don’t see any benefit to this and the headrest functioned as a good cushion. There is a handy storage compartment on the back of the seat in front, and the screen is a reasonable size. Entertainment is plentiful and the screen is slightly unresponsive. The problem I really had was the fact that they did not have enough pillows and blankets for everyone. It seemed that they placed them on random seats, although I suspect the passenger manifest would’ve been consulted for gold members, as I was given one at my seat. The legroom was pretty large and it had a large footrest.

0,blue-air,"""consider that it is a cheap airline""",11th August 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  First of all it has to be said that I only travelled with hand luggage to keep the costs as low as possible. I am also one of the people who doesn't buy food and doesn't use the toilet on a 2 hour flight so I can't say anything about it. Although I had booked Economy I was allowed to move due to free places. Therefore, my review refers to the premium seats. The aircraft was of medium age and the seats and the floor of the cabins looked clean, but had slight signs of wear. The seats in economy class are very narrow. However, they are good in the higher class. Especially since the price isn't much higher. You have to consider that it is a cheap airline. Anyway, I could sleep well although I didn't figure out how to adjust the seat. I am 6 feet tall and could sit normally in the premium class. This was not possible in economy class. The width of the seats seemed to me sufficient. So who is big and wants to fly with this airline should book Premium. Or the flight is so short you can withstand the inconvenience. If you want comfort, you should simply choose a high-priced airline. I think those who fly with Blue Air want to save money and you can do that pretty well there.

The seats on club suite are still fabric, which in my opinion, is better than leather and more comfortable. The seats now have convenient storage bins and power ports which is a very big improvement when compared to the old club world.

22,british-airways,"""I paid additional fees""",2nd January 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I booked for my wife and myself to fly to Grand Cayman with BA in November 2018. The schedule was Manchester to Heathrow then Heathrow to Grand Cayman and return flights 14 days later so 8 seats in total. At the time of booking I checked emergency exit seats were available on all flights and all seats at emergency exits were available. I am 6’2” and anyone 6’ or over will know the discomfort experienced in a normal pitch seat. BA had prices on all seats so you could reserve the seat you wanted, the seats at the emergency exits where you could see there was more space for your legs were 3 times the price of a normal seat. I paid additional fees for 8 seats at emergency exits. I receive emails from BA in July 2018 to say they had changed my seating allocation but I presumed they had just moved us to another exit seat on a like for like basis. If not I was expecting a refund, the refund never came, so I remained confident we were still seated in a like for like basis. Out of 8 emergency exits seats I paid for, we were only seated in 3. Upon my return I requested a refund from BA for 5 seats I’d paid for at a premium rate, below is their response. Thanks for getting in touch with us about your flight from Manchester on 22 November. You’re clearly disappointed with your seat because it didn’t have as much leg room as you’d expected. I completely understand why you’re feeling let down. I realise you feel you didn't get the seats you'd paid for. The maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board our flights. We can’t guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website, as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you’re travelling on. I’m afraid we can’t promise you’ll be able to sit in a particular seat on our aircraft and we do advise this in our General Conditions of Carriage, which you accept when you make your booking. This means I’m unable to offer you a refund on this occasion. I know this isn’t the answer you were hoping for and I’m sorry. I can see why you’re frustrated we didn’t meet your expectations and we’re grateful you've taken the time to let us know how you’re feeling. Thanks again for giving us the opportunity to respond to your concerns. We appreciate your support as a Blue member of our Executive Club. I hope we can welcome you on board again soon. Please feel free to contact me directly using the blue link below if I can help you with anything else. I emailed them back stating I’d paid a premium for extra leg room seats by emergency exits and I expected a refund and this was their reply. I'd like to inform you that we do inform passengers that the seat map is for guidance only and not true to scale. Extra space between rows does not indicate extra legroom. However, any exit row seat may have extra leg room, but we don't sell these seats as extra leg room seats on ba.com. The leg room may vary as per the aircraft seating configuration. I do appreciate your reasons for asking, I'm afraid we cannot refund you the prepaid seating charge. So basically, BA believe if they do not sell seats as extra legroom seats, they can charge you a premium for them, then move you to a seat you’d pay less for and not refund you the difference.

We were greeted with a glass of champagne which was a nice touch, oddly on the return Orlando to Gatwick run we had a choice of orange juice or water, disappointing to say the least. As far as perks go that was it. Food ran out so we ended up with economy food, nice but not fantastic. The back seat TV was old fashioned, small in size compared to other airlines and had a very limited choice, all in all both flights were very disappointing.

26,british-airways,"""seat itself was quite comfortable""",17th September 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Houston to London Heathrow in premium economy. The seat itself was quite comfortable, with a good seat pitch and a decent recline (we were in the back row so didn't need to worry about ruining someone else's journey by reclining into their faces). The seats had seen better days, and the whole cabin looked quite old and tatty. The screens on the back of the seats in front were tiny and quite difficult to see. In my case it was not functioning correctly anyway, but I'd brought my own entertainment so not really a problem. There was the - now usual - problem of people bringing up to five bags onboard, some of which were large suitcases, so very little room in the overhead lockers for those who'd only brought on one bag. Since our bags fitted under the seat in front this was not an issue. The biggest problem was the meal service. There were theoretically two meal options but since we were at the back of the cabin we were left with the option nobody else wanted: they called it ""spinach and ricotta ravioli"", but it was an inedible slab of dried up pasta and dried up tomato ketchup. On the plus side for us, the first choice, ""Fillet of beef with broccolini"", was also barely edible. In my experience economy gets much better meals than premium economy on most airlines. If travelling premium economy on British Airways, where one of the options is inedible slops, those at the back of the cabin will effectively get no meal because the travellers at the front get first choice. If you're travelling from London you can choose your meal beforehand, which is useful.

The screen for the entertainment was amongst the smallest i have seen and much smaller than economy class on other aircraft types. The entertainment kept skipping and had to be reset just after take off which meant no entertainment access for 30 mins. The leg room pitch was pretty good.

36,british-airways,"""I really will now avoid BA""",16th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified |  I’m a previous top tier frequent flyer with BA now currently blue. Flew to Iceland with wife and daughter. As we made our way onto the plane (from near the front of the general boarding queue), my perfectly average not heavy not oversized bag (we also had checked baggage) was taken from me to be put in the hold. I don’t know why they selected me as they then allowed practically the rest of the plane to board with their bags. I didn’t have luggage locks - my wife had them and she had boarded in front of me - and when i got on board my wife became upset because her jacket with her wallet had been in my bag because we couldn’t carry everything. She told a surly stewardess with dark hair who couldn’t have cared less. My wife questioned why my bag was taken when people with more luggage than us we being let on and the plane wasn’t completely full and she just said they’re wasn’t enough locker space. Why penalise those who arrive early at the check in then?? We’ve had stuff stolen from hand luggage placed in the BA hold before - which we mentioned to zero interest from the staff. The surly woman then proceeded to bang into my wife throughout the flight as she marched her M&S laden trolley up and down, touting the expansive tat you can buy for much less on the ground. The payment system now means those on the aisle are stuck with someone’s rear end in their faces for much longer as purchases are made, plus trolleys left in the aisle while something is heated up in the galley and trotted back out. The bags that were placed in the hold appeared very last at the baggage claim, adding to our stress. Luckily the wallet was untouched.

47,british-airways,"""preferred the old seats""",18th June 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew on one of the newest A380's, and got the upgraded premium economy cabin. The seats felt quite hard, and became really uncomfortable after a few hours. The seat pitch is just OK for someone like me who is 184 and just had knee surgery. I preferred the old seats for comfort. The IFE was of great quality, and plenty of movies to chose from. The noise cancelling headphones are good for premium economy. But there is a very bad design flaw with the seats: they cannot be brought back to the upright position without the help of a flight attendant pushing the back up. Also, it is almost impossible for the person sitting in a middle seat to get up during the night. Last but not least, there are no dedicated washrooms for premium economy - actually only a total of 4 for all the upper deck economy and premium economy passengers (and always as usual on BA, one of them is reserved for the crew)",6.0,Premium Economy,A380,2x3x2,w flew newest got upgraded premium economy cabin seats felt quite hard became really uncomfortable hours seat pitch knee surgery preferred old seats comfort great quality plenty movies chose noise cancelling headphones good premium economy bad design flaw seats can brought back upright position help flight attendant pushing back also almost impossible person sitting middle seat get night last least dedicated washrooms premium economy actually total upper deck economy premium economy passengers always usual reserved crew
48,british-airways,"""seats were the most uncomfortable""",4th June 2017,✅ Verified Review |  After a faultless flight with BA in a 777 travelling World Traveller Plus (Premium Economy)  at the start of our holiday we were aggrieved to find that the Boeing 747-400 allocated for the return journey was an aircraft clearly at the end of a long service and one that did not meet the demands of a modern airline competing for customers. The aircraft was dirty with a thick layer of dust between the window seat and the cabin wall. There were cup ring marks on the arms and the seats were the most uncomfortable I think I have sat on for a long flight of nearly 9 hours in any class including economy. The cushion area was devoid of any 'cushioning' and the seats were worn and old looking. The TV had a screen not much bigger than my mobile and the quality was so poor I decided that I would use my phone and listen to the music for the entire trip home. This is the first time I have ever felt that I could not tolerate the poor screen quality. I had to wear my glasses just to try and follow the on screen commands. The only positive was that the earphones provided worked well on my phone and the noise cancelling removed most of the inflight noise. At a time when BA seem to be moving away from their prestige airline image that has been their selling point for many years I really can not understand why customers travelling long distances should have to be transported in such awful planes. My only serious satisfaction is that I did not accept the offer to upgrade to business. First of all the price offered was too much and secondly when I checked out the business class it did not look in anyway inviting.

Now they charge you (even their loyalty card holders!) if you are travelling without a checked in bag & want to change the terrible seat they have assigned you. And British Airways are doing it in a very sly way, in my opinion. I have flown 3 times with them during the last month. Each time with a colleague. And on every occasion the seats have been assigned to us at the very rear of the plane, and every time without a window seat. They've done this despite plenty of free seats being available in the mid & front of the plane. There is only 1 reason - they do it specifically to force you to pay for a seat change. Have a look at the seat map from todays flight that I have attached. Despite there being numerous free seats around, they've put us at the back of the plane and on both sides of an aisle so we cant even talk together comfortably. And I was checking in only a few minutes after the online check in opened - so there was no lack of available seats. There are some other airlines also charge for seat selection, but normally they are low cost carriers. British Airways charges premium fees for its seats and is a national carrier. This is pure greed. If you don't take a checked in bag, you are saving BA money. So why should they punish you in return? They save time/money on loading the plane - on staff at the check in desk - on downtime at the gate - on risk due to terror hype - on paying to replace lost baggage and  belongings and on fuel due to less weight etc. They should reduce the ticket price, not increase it!

145,british-airways,British Airways customer review,25th July 2014,This was my first experience in World Traveler Plus. I have traveled coach and business previously. It is an improvement on coach in terms of legroom and seat comfort the cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery. (How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen. One factor in favour of coach is that the hand-rests fold back so that if you're lucky enough to be the sole passenger in a row of 3 or 4 you can lie across the seats and enjoy a business class standard lie-flat bed.

The TV screen is very small and in my case fell out of it's housing and despite efforts by the crew to hold it in place with sticky tape they were not successful.

170,british-airways,British Airways customer review,1st January 2013,LHR-JFK-LHR. Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening.

The support and inflight entertainment control box from the seat in front reduced the legroom I could use. Likewise legroom underneath was constrained by a support bar. I was near the front of the premium economy cabin and found it claustrophobic and stuffy as they closed the business class curtain and raised the ottoman blind completely so it was like facing a wall close up. The zip of the inflight kit bag they gave broke the first time I opened it and the toothpaste inside tasted terrible. The seat was in the aisle and it was rather narrow. In fact as the photo shows the passenger on my left was sitting on my seat. The passenger in front reclined their seat all the way but as least I could do the same without any diminished tv viewing.

30,cathay-pacific-airways,"""sleeping a much easier task""",15th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Cathay's premium economy class makes a 16-hour flight tolerable, albeit a far cry from its business product. Compared to regular economy, premium economy has an additional 6 inches in length and 1.5 inches in width. Coupled with a footrest, this alleviated the usual knee-bumping; legroom is not an issue. However, elbow space will remain an issue for larger passengers. By far the biggest perk of this seat is the 8-inch recline and the extra padding, which makes sleeping a much easier task. When the passenger in front of you reclines, however, it may be difficult for you (and your seatmate) to leave and use the lavatory; your space may feel constricted unless you recline as well.

First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I've sat on. The fact that the seat doesn't recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I'm average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it's probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there's also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you can't fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration.

The people who designed those seats probably never even had the chance to sit on them because otherwise such seat would not be existing. It's absurd, but I only got to sleep when I was finally sitting on a narrow coach seat in Economy from Taipei to Singapore. Other than that: The aircraft couldn't depart on time, we had to wait more than two hours sitting in the aircraft due to difficulties at Frankfurt Airport. Staff was chatting with each other, but not looking after passengers, they didn't serve any beverages during these 2 hours! In Taipei China Airlines didn't manage to transfer my luggage to my connecting flight to Singapore. My bag was missing in Singapore, I had to wait 30 hours for my bag to be delivered to my hotel the next day. Staff tried to be nice. Food and beverages was okay, but no difference to Economy (plastic, plastic, plastic and no choice of meals). All in all: a disastrous experience.

1,china-airlines,"""no issue falling asleep""",30th May 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was my first time flying on China Airlines. The cabin design of the A350 was gorgeous, classy, yet modern. The seat pitch was unbelievably wide. I can literally stretch my leg comfortably and I had no issue falling asleep. However, the design of the seat pocket itself is a little bit uncomfortable to me.

3,china-southern-airlines,"""an absolute nightmare""",2nd May 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  China Southern Airlines were an absolute nightmare. My flight from Sydney to Guangzhou was redirected to Hainan due to ‘bad weather’ in Guangzhou. We were not allowed off the plane and had to sit and wait for 7 hours until ‘the weather cleared up’ (even though our connecting flight took off an hour before we finally arrived in Guangzhou so we think they overbooked the flight). They had to ration food and drinks because stock was limited. When we finally arrived in Guangzhou, we spent over 150 AUD on the lounge in the airport as we had to wait for another 4 hours for the new flight they put us on to Ho Chi Minh and we were exhausted and wanted to sleep, shower and eat as the airlines did not provide any facilities or food during this stopover. Because of this delay my sister and myself missed out on a full day in Ho Chi Minh. The 4 hour delay for the flight back home from Hanoi to Guangzhou causing us to miss our connecting flight to Sydney created absolute chaos. We had to wait in a queue in Guangzhou airport at 11pm with hundreds of other passengers with missed connecting flights for over 2 hours. They finally announced there were no more flights back to Australia that night and that they would process everyone one day visas and provide accomodation for the night. By the time all this was processed it was 2am and we were told we needed to be back at the airport at 6am in order to queue to be put on standby for flights back to Australia. We ended up staying in the airport all night (which we were entirely unprepared for as the airport was freezing cold and we were in summer clothes and we did not have Chinese Yuan so had to pay for tea in the morning with our Australian debit cards which gave us a terrible exchange rate and there was no free clean drinking water in the airport) and from 5:30am had to wait another 2 hours in a queue until we were told there were no more seats available for any flights back to Australia until the 1st May. This was on the 28th April (our original flight was meant to be on the 27th April). China Southern’s customer service was terrible, there was barely any communication, there were parents with children waiting in the queue and people with no access to internet as China blocks access to people without WeChat. No refunds or flights with other airlines were offered, and it was expected that you come back to the airport from your accommodation everyday to get another day visa until a flight opened up. This is when my sister and I decided to make our own way back home, which took 4 days in total. The only affordable option home was through Hong Kong, Singapore and Gold Coast. We are now 2,000 AUD out of pocket due to booking new flights and other expenses such as meals and water, data roaming and taxi fares. We are both exhausted and came down with colds due to the chilly air conditioned airports and had to take 2 extra days of annual leave.

14,china-southern-airlines,"""deceiving the customer""",12th September 2016,"The inflight staff on this flight were excellent and the service was very professional. However, the same cannot be said for China Southern Administration. The route of my flight from Guangzhou to Rome was changed from a direct flight Guangzhou to Rome to an additional domestic leg within China. This meant we flew Guangzhou - Wuhan - Rome. An official notification email to opt out of this change was sent while I was in-flight from Brisbane to Guangzhou. This in effect made any decision not to take the changed flight impossible. Consequently on arrival in Guangzhou a normal transit situation between international sectors became an horrific nightmare involving moving through many levels of additional security because of the added domestic leg, my passport being taken away and then given to a Chinese person (I am not of chinese ethnicity!), and lost for a period of time, the need to try and find my passport, the loss of purchased duty free items, abuse by ground staff and so on. It was the most dreadful flying experience of my life. I believe the email sent during the first leg of the flight an incredibly cynical exercise in China Southern Airlines deceiving the customer and a disgusting attempt to lie to passengers about flight changes.

The flight attendants offered a drink service, then a refill service, then walked thru the cabin with coffee, the walked thru with water. The FC flight attendant also help with Comfort Plus. Lots of smiles and engagements by this flight crew. Simply fantastic. Short connection in RDU, which is very nice and easy, by the way. Next CRJ-900 flight to Austin, 3hr 37 min gate to gate. Not a next gen aircraft, however the seats were very comfortable and again with good legroom. Seat next to me was empty (when does this ever happen, especially right after Thanksgiving).

The resultant effect is complete sleepless, restless & discomfort night, and we were exhausted on our arrival. To make the matter worst, I had my arms and body wedged in the seat (meaning that the seat canopy was not wide enough to fit my body size). And I consider myself as medium built of 175cm @ 85kg.

19,emirates,"""Legroom is just about ok""",30th December 2016,"✅ Verified Review |  Seats were chosen when I booked online 7 months prior. Requested Row 42J/K on the A380 and 46J/K on the Boeing 777. On the A380, Row 42 is the second row from the front on the lower deck, meaning there is no middle set of seats, just the forward stairs going to the upper deck (business and first class seats). Also, being forward of the wing and engines mean it's a quieter part of the cabin. The seat width is sufficient for the 7 hour journey between London and Dubai. Legroom is just about ok, but when the seat in front is reclined, you do have to make an adjustment if you are watching the tv screen. Screen is a good size, and the ICE entertainment system offers a vast selection of movies and box sets to keep you occupied. A good plus is that these films can be started immediately, so you can start your entertainment while the aircraft is still preparing for departure. However, we were surprised that the cabin crew come round to collect the headsets prior to landing. My advice is always travel with your own headsets (and adaptors). There are charging ports available so if you are using your own equipment, you won't run out of juice. Food and drink is complimentary (as is expected from an airline of this standard). However, the meal choice was the same as offered on the same route in 2013. Would have thought the menu could have been changed in three years. On the Boeing 777, Row 46 is five rows from the rear of the aircraft and as such, is the first Row where the layout reduces from 3-4-3 to 2-4-2. If you are travelling as a couple, the side seats on Rows 46 to 49 are the ones to aim for (Row 50 suffers from being too close to the galley and toilets). Seats are fine in width, but as they have three seats in front, you can angle your legs across to get more legroom. So a definite plus there. We had booked the same rows for our return flights.

This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5'8"" and average size.

As other passengers have also commented about these seats I ended up having to use the blanket to pad the seat and wrap it around the forward seat edge to lessen its cutting into my thigh. In the fully reclined position the flat bed is not long enough for people of my height so I have to settle for it semi reclines with my feet resting on something placed on the floor.

15,etihad-airways,"""not acceptable at all""",24th February 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  Travelling as a couple I was disgusted to find when I checked in online they deliberately allocated seats at opposite sides of the aircraft on all 4 flights (2 outward and 2 return) but offer you the chance to pay to select 'your favourite seat' for £30 each. Given there was not a spare next to each one it would mean £60 per flight, £120 1 way and £240 total for the basic right of sitting next to your partner. Th original flights cost £1200 so it's an extra 10% so sit together, not acceptable at all. For clarity, it was 1 booking and checked it as 1. I can understand sometimes you get 1 aisle, then the next aisle seat but we had opposite sides of the plane (9 seats apart and 1 row in front, some several rows apart and non anywhere near each other) yet when I looked at paying to move I could see that a good 75% of the aircraft was selectable i.e free. It's also worth noting 2 of the flights were only 60% full on take off so this was clearly not an issue with a fully booked plane I've added some screenshots as proof of what is simply a crooked way to get more money from customers who have already paid a decent price for the flight in the first place. The black seats are the seats we were allocated, all the blue are the ones free. This was only half the aircraft, the other half had all seats free to select.

17,etihad-airways,"""one of the worst airlines""",6th November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hands down one of the worst airlines I've travelled with. We booked with Etihad because we made the assumption they were a premium airline with a high service level therefore worth the price. We were wrong. Budget airline service at premium prices. The outward leg of this journey from London-Singapore via Abu Dhabi was vastly worse than the return. The seats are very cramped. My seat was broken on both legs meaning I could not recline and when the person in front did, I was left with 6 inches between my face and their seat back. Both myself and my partner left both flights incredibly dehydrated - we had to ask multiple times for water (it is NOT acceptable to serve liquids only twice in 7 hours, especially not when you insist on filling the thimble sized cups only halfway). After asking a second time for liquids, the cabin crew ignored and subsequently turned off my partners request button before getting annoyed when he went to the galley to ask. To say the food was revolting is an understatement. No menus are provided on board and the staff do not describe the meal past ""chicken, lamb or vegetarian"". Dinner consisted of a rock hard bread roll, a bone dry cous cous 'salad' (not that there were any vegetables in it) and in my case some dry pasta with a small amount of tomato sauce and a dry cake - apparently vegetables are not part of the Etihad service. What a come down after having experienced food on Emirates or Malaysian Airlines! The snack comprised a hot pastry before we disembarked. Food on the second flight was no better - bland cold noodle salad then ""Spicy chicken noodles"" which was actually more slimy than spicy and a snack comprising a rock hard bread roll with a smear of mystery filling. The second leg from Abu Dhabi to Singapore was a source of greater annoyance as it was announced that we would be delayed AFTER they had boarded us, probably by an hour or something (90 minutes eventually sat without water). We had onward transport arranged and were trying to figure out if we would still make it. Questioning the passengers around us it turned out that our tickets all had different scheduled arrival times on them and the crew had no idea what our original landing time should have been. If you want extra snacks between meals then good luck - in line with budget carriers you have to pay extra for this! Given how much the flight tickets are, this has to be a joke. One wonders if this is why the food is so poor - to encourage people to buy extras. The entertainment system is another source of annoyance - endless advertisements and announcements which interrupt it for 5 minutes at a time. Screen pop ups advertising snacks or duty free are also extremely irritating. The system does not start up until you've been in the air for 30-40 minutes and then shuts down 40 mins to an hour before you land, mostly without warning. Charging for seats up until 24 hours before the flight departs also seems tight - some of the seats cost £60 to reserve. That's obscene. I discovered on the return leg (Singapore - Abu Dhabi - London) that delayed departures are so common for Etihad that their scheduled flight and arrival times are essentially meaningless, having spent another hour sitting on the tarmac at Abu Dhabi for no apparent reason. This was our first time travelling with Etihad and it will certainly be our last. Appalling, careless service at inflated prices.

To their credit, Frontier brought in a new plane and new crew rather than just cancel the flight and they gave us a travel voucher. The seats on the A320 were the most uncomfortable seats I've ever experienced on an airline. Or anywhere else for that matter. It is difficult to imagine anyone in the Frontier front office approving these seats for installation after sitting in them. They don't recline, they have a ridiculously small tray table and they are extremely uncomfortable -- like sitting on a thin blanket placed on a hard bench. The seats are so uncomfortable that I would have to seriously re-consider ever flying Frontier again -- even with the free travel voucher. Our flight was relatively short, but a longer flight sitting on these ""seats"" is unfathomable. I suspect Frontier did a cost analysis in which they factored in the lost revenue from people like me who won't fly Frontier again because of these seats vs. the additional revenue gained from packing more sardines into the can.

The reclining of the seats is acceptable, but you can't go very far. Of course, this is understandable because of the fact that the person behind you also likes to keep some space.

4,icelandair,"""aircraft the most uncomfortable""",30th April 2017,"❎ Unverified |  We normally book with IcelandAir for flights to Europe from Boston, primarily because there is an extra inch of legroom in economy than what you get on most carriers. It also gives a midway break at Keflavik and an option to spend a few days in Iceland at no additional cost for the flights. (We have done that 3 times). Another advantage is that you enter passport control into Europe in Iceland which saves time when you arrive at your final destination. Our only experience where this did not apply was for a flight to London where we had to go through passport control again. On this last trip from Boston to Stockholm, the first leg was on a recently acquired, used Boeing 767 that had also been recently refurbished. The seats that they put into the aircraft are the most uncomfortable we have ever encountered. The second leg was on a 757 and the seats were a bit more comfortable With added traffic, Keflavik is grossly undersized for the number of people in there at any one time. It is so crowded that you can barely move and there is virtually no seating at the gates. Air travel in general is a miserable experience.

8,icelandair,"""considering a different airline""",30th October 2015,"While I could not classify my exact seat as Saga Class, this review is for that, which essentially is Icelandair's Business Class seating, as a 2x2 config aboard their Boeing 757-200 aircraft.  The seating has ample padding, but if you are seated in the first row, either side of the aircraft, you will find a lack of footrest, which can make it uncomfortable for a tall person - having that lack of footrest, causes an uncomfortable recline to the seat. Three of the four aircraft I flew on my trip, this was the case, with the one aircraft, being an upgraded model, had cubbies at the foot of the bulkhead, which you could stash a backpack and keep your feet there if you are tall. Also, sitting in the first row, means that your entertainment system is stashed in the armrests, which are always very warm, due to the systems being confined inside. Depending on an older or newer aircraft, will depend on whether your In-Flight entertainment system functions well. The pop-out drink tray at the front of the armrest section can and will get stuck, so you will then be lacking space for drinks, which can spill very easily on the above drink trays in front of the armrests. The USB ports for charging, well they charge very slow.

We went there and asked, how can we have bought the last 2 tickets in this aircraft and have the last two spots in the middle if there are people with no seat assigned? And he just told me “I said you can upgrade for 80$, if you don’t just have a nice trip, bye”. They were rude and impolite, they didn’t solve our problem and it was clear that they have a software that automatically assigns you and your partner far apart just to upgrade and pay more money. None of us was assigned at the window or the aisle because it’s harder to switch places in the aircraft with someone if you are assigned in the middle (if one of us would have had aisle or window seat would have been much easier). Overall, we were very disappointed and angry because they don’t have the desire to help you.

Dirt was noticeable everywhere even on the bright orange uniforms. Cabin crew were particularly noisy in the galley and I often felt them bumping against the board in front. What was particularly bad in terms of customer service however was that there was only 1 magazine for seats 1A to 1F and although initially I was lucky to have it the head cabin crew snatched it from my pocket without asking to check the price of a blanket for a rear seated (and less entitled passenger) and never returned it even though I never had a chance to read it.,2.0,Economy Class,A320,3x3,sat upfront seats supposed better ones disappointed find hardly legroom right front redline floor passengers seated behind could seem keep aisle kept spilling seat space children treading armrest carried parents flight left late lot passengers stick allocated seats somehow made door boarding pass dirt noticeable everywhere even bright orange uniforms cabin crew particularly noisy galley often felt bumping board front particularly bad terms customer service however magazine seats initially lucky head cabin crew snatched pocket asking check price blanket rear seated less entitled passenger never returned even never chance read

On our flight to Amsterdam from Hong Kong my husband couldn't actually fit/sit in the super narrow seats. How embarrassing. We travel frequently and this has never happened. Luckily, the purser upgraded him to business and promised to send an email warning them about our return journey in a week's time. But when we checked into our flight home to HK there was no record of this issue. In fact, once we were directed to the ticket counter to get some help, the woman there was incredibly rude, telling us it's our fault for not checking the seat width online (I guess assuming that an international carrier that offers ""economy comfort"" would be like every other international carrier we've flown was the wrong thing to do after all).

62,klm-royal-dutch-airlines,"""the worst flight I've experienced""",28th July 2015,"Been flying with KLM for over 25 years now in various classes but last experience in economy from Houston to Amsterdam was the worst flight I've ever experienced. I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply wasn't enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg couldn't fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and can't move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet couldn't get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat.  We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it's passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you're tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you'll probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we're happy even though we know you're not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that's the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions.

The seat in front was so close that one could not even bend forward to pick up anything off the floor. The heat was high in the plane, and there were no individual air vents that one can open or close. My husband felt so ill from the heat and oppressive atmosphere that he tried to stand up and almost fainted. After that they lowered the temperature in the cabin to cooler levels. They also took him to the back of the plane where the stewardesses are seated and it is cooler back there. The breakfast food was budget (a small muffin and tiny cup of fruit salad). The plane arrived close to on time - about 20 mins late due to lack of wind over the Atlantic.  For the good: the staff on plane were very nice, and the dinner was OK. Other than the friendly staff, you might as well be flying the cheapest charter you know.

18,lufthansa,"""enhancing the passenger experience""",19th May 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Had the pleasure of flying Premium Economy with Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on a pleasure trip.  I chose Lufthansa based on value for money; the same applies for Premium Economy. A standard economy seat was £500 and PE was £800. The price gap was so reasonable compared to other airlines (particularly BA and Virgin) that I thought I'd opt for the additional comfort. The initial Premium Economy experience doesn't differ from Economy. There are no airport perks, no priority check in etc; however, the substantial difference comes when you embark. The seats are akin to a domestic/pre-lie flat business class seat with a wide chair, leg rest, deeper than normal incline and in seat amenities. As a bonus I also chose an end of aisle seat so I had slightly more leg room, and of course the added bonus of no one inclining in to me! The additional service includes food service on crockery instead of out of cartons, glasses instead of plastic cups, metal cutlery, a menu with meal choices and an arrival drink. All of these are minor touches, however they all add up to enhancing the passenger experience. The amenities kit that comes with the seat is simple and welcomed; an eye mask, a tooth brush, travel socks and a face wipe all I a personalised pouch. Other additions include a blanket and pillow on arrival. The staff weren't dedicated to the seat; however they were friendly, attentive and polite and were more than willing to service your ad hoc needs throughout the flight. The only criticisms are the lack of pre flight benefits, and lack of separation and dedicated facilities from Economy passengers.

I was a little disappointed with the IFE. The screens were a little small and you had to use the earphones provided which were a bit flimsy.

My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats.

Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck. This is really cool however there are only 5 of them.

Although sold as business class, it is really more like Premium Economy. The seat was comfortable, reclined back and the leg portion went forward. There is a footrest that pulls down and out. Plenty of leg room. Video monitor is inside the arm rest on the left, and the tray table pulls out from the other arm rest. The new large windows have window darkening features so you don't pull down a shade. The flight attendants can control those if someone by a window doesn't have their shade down and they are asleep. You are not given any amenity kit, but they do provide a blanket - no pillow. The only challenge I had with these seats is the leg portion doesn't extend out that far so you are left in a semi recline position with your knees bent. After a 9 hour flight my knees hurt! I was dreading this flight after reading the reviews, but it wasn't bad. Premium economy is definitely worth the additional money for this flight. The cabin is broken up into a smaller segment of 5 rows, there is a wall, and another cabin area which I thought was also Premium Economy, but the seat chart says it is economy. If so, that would definitely be a good area to sit in as it is more secluded from the main body of the plane. Service was o.k., food was not that great, but you do get two hot meals.

I could extend my legs without hitting the seat in front. This was not the case however. I felt sorry for the poor person in front as I continually bumped his seat trying to get comfortable.

52,qantas-airways,"""seat reclined fully""",13th January 2014,We travelled in the 'green' section and in seats 38 DEF which were at the back of the section with a wall behind us. My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well.

My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable.

Fine for children or those missing a left leg lousy for anyone else. (I might add that I had more leg room on my 40 minute connecting flight to Canberra in Economy on a 737-800 than for the 12+ hours flight from London to Singapore.)

67,qantas-airways,"""seats recline beautifully""",15th February 2013,LAX to Sydney. The economy A380 seats are a disgrace. The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately. The seats recline beautifully - except the lovely recline means you are lying in someone's lap and someone is probably lying in your lap. This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do. The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined. Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat. The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in. There is less leg room than any other flight I've been on in my life. To eat requires the capacity to keep one's arms glued to one's sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor. The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches. The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it. Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it. I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I didn't have to bother that poor guy again. The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you can't get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seat.I weigh 100 lbs/about 47 kg. I am thin and not tall. This seat was uncomfortable for me. Now imagine what it is like for any normal human.

With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control.

94,qantas-airways,"""managed a decent amount of sleep""",14th October 2009,Premium Economy LHR-SYD-LHR A380. I had my eye on 38J and K (exit row rear right of the cabin) and managed to get them there and back. This gave us (me + wife) masses of legroom so that wasn't an issue. Recline is OK and we managed a decent amount of sleep though it still felt like airline sleep rather than truly restful sleep. Food was ordinary in truth though nicely served on linen china etc. Staff were excellent on three of the four legs. We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew. On SYD-SIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas -then repeated this as we approached SIN! Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence. IFE is first-class; touch- screen intuitive interface and loads of choice. First time I've taken more than a passing interest. Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during take-off and landing - precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you can't watch that part of the proceedings. And finally beware - while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest. This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it's next to the door - though I can't believe this would be the cause of a draught! In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces. This was true on both trips (both A380s but different aircraft). So while I'd recommend Premium Economy I'm not sure this is the best place to sit. The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag (we've done this trip quite a lot) and said she would do it again which is not true of 'standard' Economy (there's no going back to Economy now).,8.0,Premium Economy,A380,2x3x2,ye exit row rear right cabin managed back gave wife masses legroom issue ok managed decent amount sleep still felt airline sleep rather truly restful sleep food ordinary truth nicely served linen staff excellent legs addressed name several occasions smiling crew syd sin leg customer services manager walked around met cabin shook hands thanked flying repeated approached sin premium economy cabin quite close tail lateral movement quite noticeable turbulence first class touch screen intuitive interface loads choice first time taken passing interest disappointment screen stowed take landing precisely skycam tail entertaining watch part proceedings finally beware seats best cabin legroom also chilliest may galley cooled may next door would cause draught case much warmer rows forward cover excellent blankets avoid worst still uncomfortably cool draught faces true trips different aircraft recommend premium economy sure best place sit ultimate measure wife suffered lot less usual terminal jetlag done trip quite lot said would true standard economy going back economy

However the services desk informed me that if I wanted an exit seat and sat by the window I would not have to pay anything at all - given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me.

22,qatar-airways,"""seat and strange noise let it down for me""",6th December 2017,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was travelling from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha with Qatar Airways, but on-board a couple of Boeing 787 it was tolerable but wasn't great. The legroom isn't great for people over six foot and trying to get past another passenger is very difficult (and the people next to me would not stand up) I was in the window seat 15/16A, which was nice (especially for sleeping) and the large window is great but had even less leg space due to the presence of a large silver IFE box. The seat recline was quite useless - it didn't seem to stay so you had to keep pressure leaning back (I don't normally recline anyway out of respect for others) Whenever the person in front reclined I was very cramped and couldn't move much - forget about accessing the aisle. Having 9 seats in each row is quite a lot in reality, it can result in some armrest battles with your neighboring passengers from slightly narrow seats. Maybe 8 would have given a better customer experience. Ironically my first flight to Doha had just 50 people on-board so I didn't have a problem there but my connections from then onward were much busier. Finally, there was a very annoying high pitched noise throughout the whole flight, which is either from the lights or the IFE boxes. It was rhythmic and once I had noticed it I couldn't ignore it sadly. On both of my Boeing 787 connections this noise was present so I know it wasn't this specific flight. Aside from the obligatory safety leaflet and an in-flight magazine (didn't know people still read these, hah) the seat storage was decent.

0,silkair,"""worst business class seat""",25th November 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  
Absolutely the worst business class seat I have ever experienced! OK the width of the seat is acceptable, but the legroom is absolutely appalling - less even than I would expect in a normal premium economy seat. Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls, such as they are, for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical leavers (no electronic adjustment) so for example to recline push hard back on the lever then physically push the seat back. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! In addition there is literally no in flight entertainment system, at least in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds issued and recovered, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course. I found it impossible to doze let alone sleep on the 4.5 hours midnight flight so tried to pass the time with the limited selection of English language films on the iPad. Literally the only redeeming feature of the whole miserable experience was the cabin crew who try their best to give high quality and attentive service.

14,singapore-airlines,"""not impressed with the design""",2nd March 2019,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew SQ833 and SQ255, Shanghai to Brisbane via Singapore on 27/28 February. On these journeys and on previous SQ journeys, I've flown Premium Economy. I am not at all impressed with the design of the seats. They're not particularly comfortable. Leg room could be OK with ingenuity. The folding trays slotted between the seats often cause all sorts of inconvenience to passengers and staff since they have to be stowed ""just so"" or they don't stow without awkwardness and delay. The lid covering the trays has no obvious lifting point or slot or button or ... On the 380 there were two buttons below the cover that had nothing to do with the cover but which seemed that they might do. I pressed one. A sort of thigh/leg support appeared. It was not wanted. I pressed retract. Nothing happened so there we were stuck with a half-projected support for the rest of the flight. Then there's the point for insertion of the head phone plugs - to the side and behind the passenger. A meal arrives, the tray has to be extracted and later retracted. And then there's a nice mix up of headphones cable , tray table, tray and confused passenger. Then there's the prissy little ""pocket"" on the back of the seat in front that may need to contain a laptop, an ipad, a documents gag, the free bottle of water and some medications. Well, well. Good luck with that - after a sick bag, a Kris world magazine, a Kris Flyer magazine, an emergency procedures card all have prior place.

19,singapore-airlines,"""seats are very shallow and flat""",23rd November 2018,"✅ Trip Verified |  Having had an outbound journey with Singapore Airlines in business class, we came back in premium economy, and the difference could not be more stark! While the base spec of their premium economy offering appears on paper very similar to many others, we were very disappointed when comparing them to, for example, Virgin. The seats are among the most uncomfortable we had ever sat in, making the 13.5 hour flight to London from Singapore a real test of endurance. To put this into perspective, the economy seats we had on Singapore Airlines sister carrier Silk Air for an earlier connecting flight were exceptionally comfortable! The use of a solid centre divider between each pair of seats means you are hemmed in (they claim 19.5 inches width, but I think its more like 17!) and achieving any diagonal recline is very hard. The seats are also very shallow and flat, meaning that when reclining you start to slide off - not helped by a bizarre thigh support pop-out and ridiculous footrest, when don't work together well at all. The seat needs to be more bucket shaped to be in any way comortable, and a 2x3x2 format would help achieve a more premium feel. Legroom is also deceptively similar to economy. All in all, we were very disappointed, and given that at current prices, you can find upgrades to business class on LHR-SIN return for about 35-40% additional, we'd rather do that. We certainly won't fly Singapore Airlines premium economy again, but instead look to use business class and save on other areas of trips.",3.0,Premium Economy,Boeing 777-300ER,2x4x2,business class came back premium economy difference could stark base economy offering appears paper similar many others disappointed comparing example virgin seats uncomfortable ever sat making hour flight real test endurance put perspective economy seats sister air earlier connecting flight exceptionally comfortable use solid divider pair seats means hemmed claim inches width think achieving diagonal recline hard seats also shallow flat meaning reclining start slide helped bizarre thigh support pop ridiculous footrest work together well seat needs bucket shaped way comortable format would help achieve premium feel legroom also deceptively similar economy disappointed given current prices find upgrades business class lhr sin return additional rather certainly fly premium economy instead look use business class save areas trips

In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil).

The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it. The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed (I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look) and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support (via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve. There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support). The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs. The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat. Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good (but not as good as on the A380) as was the food.

7,spirit-airlines,"""blew away my expectations""",21st November 2017,"✅ Trip Verified |  My experience with Spirit blew away my expectations. I flew Spirit coming home from a trip in which I flew in with JetBlue (which has always been my favorite). JetBlue gave me a bit of a hassle because my ticket was booked under my married name and all my IDs are still in my maiden name (whoops!). But when I arrived early to change my boarding pass with Spirit, they were nothing but cheerful and helpful. They changed it with no problem and gave me no attitude or anything (whereas I received a few huffs and eye-rolls from JetBlue). I was still nervous about my seat. When I finally boarded the plane the seats looked normal. My seat was  clean, despite a couple of stains on the tray table. No big deal. No tv on the back of the seat, but I had downloaded a couple movies on my phone. You have to pay for food, but whatever. I think water and soda was like $3, and the snacks were around there. I'm between 5'7"" and 5'8"" and around 145lbs and found my seat to be comfortable. Or, I'll say this: I was equally comfortable on this seat than I was on my JetBlue seat. Both flights were about 5 hours, and sitting on anything for that long is bound to make your bum a little sore. I was able to stretch my legs out underneath the seat in front of me sort of, and rest my head on the window. I even slept! Going into this flight I thought I'd never fly Spirit again. Now I know I will. JetBlue will probably always be my gold standard (free food!!), but Spirit is a close second.

Specifically, our family had the centre group of four seats immediately in front of the galley. None of us are tall, so leg room is not a problem. We had two problems which applied to all four seats: 1. the seats don't recline very far; 2. in-flight entertainment problems: a. the entertainment handsets didn't work. We could not activate reading lights, call staff button, control the screen (volume, program, menu, etc. )or play games. b. volume control buttons at the bottom of the screens didn't work. c. touch screens weren't calibrated properly. We soon figured out we had to touch above, or to the right of the desired selection. d. screens wouldn't tilt. When the row in front reclined, we couldn't see the screens properly because our seats didn't recline to match and the screens were pointing down. Because of the problems above, I gave up on in-flight entertainment soon after take-off and pulled out a book. Unfortunately, once the cabin lights were turned off, I had to give up on that as well because there was no way to activate the reading light.

On the plus side our replacement aircraft was one of the longhaul Airbus A330s with the downstairs toilets. These have been refurbished and what a difference from previous experiences, unrecognizable from the Airtours and Mytravel days. Much wider, comfortable slimline seats, which meant me as a 6 foot plus person could stretch my legs right out under the seat in front without bruising my shins, plus personal on demand TV screens which the crew unlocked all the additional films for us all, a nice touch. We enjoyed our pre booked meals and we find the meals on Thomas Cook are always good since James Martin had some input. We like the fact that the seat recline button is slightly hidden, so most people don't realize it's there which means you're less likely to have a seat in your face all flight. On the return flight we were delighted to find once again the A330 was taking us home, this time a much newer one, but again with the same great cabin refurbishment.

All quite fine, except for the newer A321s from tailsign TC-JSN onwards carrying the Thales Avant IFE system on board. Of course it's pretty awesome to see a 3D view of the plane on the flight stats channel, but why do they have to come with huge boxes for the IFE under the seat in front of you?  If you're lucky to have a seat with one of those things waiting for you, be prepared to sit misaligned for the whole flight and - if you have big feet plus it's a window seat - to squeeze your feet over each other in the little space left between the IFE box and the cabin wall. Also forget to use the IFE boxes as a footrest, they come with sharp edges and you'd also kick the person sitting in front of you in the back.

In the rear economy cabin, under seats B, D and J you find big boxes for the inflight entertainment, under seats A, E, F and K you find huge ones. Only the G seats come with sufficient legroom. While the big boxes do reduce the legroom, the huge boxes leave only room for one foot (no room for the left foot under A and E seats, no room for the right foot under F and K seats). Didn't check the forward economy cabin, so maybe the position of the IFE boxes is a bit different. The boxes don't have sharp edges so you can put a foot on them. Besides, there are footrests installed, but only in front of the IFE boxes. So at every seat you find a misaligned footrest for only one of your feet, depending if the IFE box is on the right or left side of the seat in front of you. When folded up, the footrest bumps against you knee (also just one of your both) when the person in front of you reclines the seat. Needless to say that these notorious IFE boxes make it impossible to somehow sit comfortable - you have the choice between one foot up, one down or sitting misaligned with your feet over each other.

We definitely got our leg room, but when I tried to sit in my seat, I couldn't fit. Our arm rests did not go up, so no relief there. I am slightly overweight, but not enough to have ever caused this. I have plenty of length left on my seatbelt and I don't have trouble fitting into seats. This, however, was punitive. When I finally managed to squeeze into the seat, I couldn't bend over and had massive trouble getting OUT of the seat. I have bruises on my hips from the seat. And all of our shoulders and arms overlapped which means we were all hunched forward the entire 6 hours in order to fit into this space. I have since learned that United has ""ultra slim"" seats. Anything to make more money. The customer will pay, no worries. I hate United and will never fly them again. I ended up not being able to walk properly for hours after the flight.

Then they send us emails to bid for an upgrade to their idea of business class at an extra minimum cost of $250 per seat. They have reduced the legroom of the economy seats to a ridiculous width to fit in the economy X seats at the front of the plane behind business class. The solution to me is also obvious.

3,wow-air,"""airline is a rip off""",5th March 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  Crammed in like sardines. The perk was an outlet plug for electrical devices. It wasn't visible under and in between the seats, so you have to share, if you can find them. This tight space was my temporary home for almost 9 hours while sweating like a dog because of the HOT cabin temperature. I just came from a cold country and was crowded by my jacket and my cold weather clothes I stripped off to endure the heat. See pic, I had to take a pic of the plug just to feel around and find it.

4,wow-air,"""you get what you pay for""",7th January 2017,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked a flight from LAX to Amsterdam via Reykjavik. WOW air is like any other value carrier, you get what you pay for and what you get is a flight on a newer plane that is clean and has a great cabin crew. I checked the web page and it is clear what is allowed. One carry on and a personal bag. I took a back pack that was a big larger than what was required, but I knew if I had to stuff it in the required space it would fit.  Your carry on should not weigh more than 20 lbs, and the personal bag did not have a weight limit. I paid for luggage and I knew it had to weigh under 40 lbs. Not rocket science just follow the rules. My seat was comfortable, I paid extra for window seats and this was such a small cost, I didn't mind. I loaded up my lap top with movies and watched movies the entire way. There is a plug between seats so loosing power is not an issue. I got hungry during the flight and bought the soda and chips for around $6 which is the same as airport pricing. The crew were so polite and nice. The only complaint is that there was a delay of 2 hours from LAX to Reykjavik, but they held the plane from Reykjavik to Amsterdam. The flight from Amsterdam was delayed 30 mins. With this airline they allow you to have a stop over in Reykjavik which I took full advantage of. Staying 5 days in the country was an amazing experience.",10.0,Economy Class,A330-300,2x4x2,w booked flight reykjavik air value carrier pay get flight newer plane clean great cabin crew checked web page clear allowed carry personal bag took back pack big larger required knew stuff required space would fit carry weigh personal bag weight limit paid luggage knew rocket science follow rules seat comfortable paid extra window seats small cost mind loaded lap top movies watched movies entire way plug seats loosing power issue got hungry flight bought soda chips airport pricing crew polite nice complaint delay hours reykjavik held plane reykjavik flight delayed mins airline allow stop reykjavik took full advantage staying days country amazing experience
5,wow-air,"""Seat did not recline""",13th November 2015,"Boarding at BWI well managed, typical "" those needing assistance, young kids"", then back to front. Flight delayed from BWI managed to arrive on time KEF. Deplaned on tarmac with ample space on bus to terminal. Paid extra for XL seat 9A window. Could not sleep against plane wall - the gap between seat arm and wall was wider than carry-on. No pillows or blankets. Seat did not recline. Also seat 9A measured almost 2 inches narrowed than 9B. Row 10 was exit row - enough leg room for another row, priced as XXL seat premium, so there was ample room to allow row 9 recline. No frills, but crew were efficient and nice. Pilot woke us with message to look out at Northern Light -nice! Return flight at KEF boarding nightmare, people lined up almost an hour before departure because boarding was first-come, first-on. Took longer as you had to wait in plane aisle for people to stuff luggage at front of plane and walk back to their rear seat which left people with forward seats to hunt for overhead space in the middle and then walk back forward to their seats. Badly managed. Seat 23C their site showed this as window seat but it was middle - crew rear-facing seat blocked window. Minimal to no recline. Flight departed late, arrived within 5 minutes of schedule at BWI.

6,wow-air,"""better than expected""",5th November 2015,"Excellent flights brom BWI to KEF and KEF to BOS uneventful and on time. Much better than expected, check in fast and efficient, boarding slow due to bus transport to plane. Plane new in great condition. No entertainment of any kind, so bring your own movies. Bought XL seats on both way, one way row 2, one in exit row. Ended up paying 450 round trip with 1 piece of luggage and XL seat. The people on board were great, had Halloween costumes and gave candy to passangers.
